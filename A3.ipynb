        "To build the model, the plan of this project is to use ArcGIS library and network analyst tools implemented by Python. GIS is mainly be used to solve location-allocation problems for organizations, but seldom be used to decide the allocation of advertisement. Moreover, ArcGIS is a geographic information system (GIS) which can analyse and deal with geographic data in maps. It uses network analyst toolset to calculate and solve the location-based problems, which enables organizations to have more efficient actions and strategic decisions (ArcGIS Resources 2014).<br><br>\n",
        "Another innovation is that it also considers the influence of competitive and complementary products. It means that, if an advertisement of test product is surrounded by that of competitive product, some kinds of attentions from customers may be split, and as the result, effects of the advertisement may be reduced. On the contrary, if it is surrounded by that of complementary product, the sale may increase.Therefore, it is also crucial for teams to have competitive analyses on the locations of advertisement."
