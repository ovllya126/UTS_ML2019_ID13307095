As this reason, we try to optimize the initial model. We find the hist gradient boosting regression model is appropriate with our dataset.  The method of hist gradient boosting regression could have faster speed than gradient boosting regression when dataset is too large. The reason is that hist gradient could reduce the number of splitting points that need to be considered by pre-allocate data into integer-valued bins. On the contrary, when capacity of dataset is no longer large, this characteristic of hist gradient boosting regression would reduce the processing speed. The gradient boosting regression would become the best choice."
